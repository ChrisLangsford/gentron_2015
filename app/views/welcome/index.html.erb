                <p>
                  Gentron was founded in 1992 as a technology supply company, but soon grew to become one of the leading suppliers of IT support services in South Africa. We provide a whole host of services to our clients, all contributing to a full IT package, including professional support, strategic consulting and cloud computing.  
                  <br><br>
                  On the technology side, we provide a long list of brands, including Acer, Asus, Mecer, Gigabyte, HP, Dell, Transcend, Kensington, Samsung and Apple, along with software to provide a complete IT solution that meet the needs of our clients. Our hardware comes with an on-site warranty at no additional cost.
                  <br><br>
                  We donâ€™t simply want to be service providers, but want our clients to see us as business partners helping to make their lives easier. Consider us your outsourced IT department.
