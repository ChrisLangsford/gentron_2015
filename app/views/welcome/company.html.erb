        <p>
          Gentron was founded in 1992 as a technology supply company, but soon grew to become one of the leading suppliers of IT support services in South Africa. We provide a whole host of services to our clients, all contributing to a full IT package, including professional support, strategic consulting and cloud computing.  
          <br><br>
          On the technology side, we provide a long list of brands, including Acer, Asus, Mecer, Gigabyte, Sony, Samsung and Apple, along with software to provide a complete IT solution that meet the needs of our clients. Our hardware comes with an on-site warranty at no additional cost.
          <br><br>
          We don’t simply want to be service providers, but want our clients to see us as business partners helping to make their lives easier. Consider us your outsourced IT department.
          <br><br>
          <h4 class="section-subheading text-muted">VISION</h4>
